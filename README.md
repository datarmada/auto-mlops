# Deploy your ML models in production painlessly, immediately and scalably

Datarmada aims at **removing all the friction that comes with Machine Learning in production**.
We understand that Data Scientists are not trained to do that, and sometimes they are
not even attracted by this Software Engineering / DevOps aspect.

That is why we want to **automate this journey to production**, as well as all
the **monitoring** part and the **continuous training** one, to maintain the
deployed model healthy and performant.

**We don't make any compromise when it comes to performance**. Your model is
deployed on a Kubernetes cluster on AWS, Azure or Google Cloud Platform to be
able to handle load and scale when you need to. We use state-of-the-art technologies
such as gRPC and Terraform to ensure the performances your models deserve.
